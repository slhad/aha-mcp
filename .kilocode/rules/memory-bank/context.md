# Context

Current focus: Comprehensive MCP tool suite implementation completed, multiple transport options, tool documentation generation, and production deployment readiness.
Recent changes: Completed implementation of all many MCP tools covering automation management, entity operations, configuration flows, device registry, and Lovelace dashboard management. Added multiple transport options (stdio, SSE, streamablehttp) in [`src/mcpTransports.ts`](src/mcpTransports.ts:1). Enhanced type system with comprehensive Zod schemas in [`src/hass/types.ts`](src/hass/types.ts:1). Switched from Prettier to ESLint for code formatting and linting. Added MCP Inspector integration for automated tool extraction and documentation generation via [`scripts/tools-to-markdown.js`](scripts/tools-to-markdown.js:1).
Unit tests support dual-mode: mock and real Home Assistant instance. Test mode is determined automatically: if [`tests/hass-real-config.ts`](tests/hass-real-config.ts:1) exists, tests use real credentials (file is ignored from git/docker); otherwise, tests run in mock mode.
Project status: Feature-complete with many production-ready MCP tools, comprehensive documentation in [`tools.md`](tools.md:1), and multiple deployment options. Ready for production use with Home Assistant instances.
